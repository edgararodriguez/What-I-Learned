<h1>What I learned</h1>
<h1>Week 1</h1>
<p>This week I learned how to use github. At first I was a little confused on what to do and how to use it. But first I leanred what it does. Once I learned what it does, I started to practice using it. I used it incorrectly at first but then I restarted my practice. I wrote down the steps of Github. Then I later countinued to practice with it. What you do is create a new branch at first. Thats where you do all your work. Once you complete all your work you have to commit and push your content. Then you go into Github and merge your branch and delete it. Once you do that you go back into Source Tree and go under your master branch then you fetch and pull your work. Once everything is pulled you can now delete your other branch. Then you repeat the steps on your next branch.</p>
<h1>Week 2</h1>
<p>This week we created our groups. My group members are Davi, Caleb, Zach, and I. I beleive that we are a pretty solid group that can work well together. We also got new seats based on who is on our group. We also made a website that contained a resume. The website had a few requirements that could be easily met. While working on the project I learned new project manegment skills. We used Github for others in your group to peer review your code. We also wrote down what we learned in a word doc and our peer reviews as well. We also started to learn how to make websites resonsive. At first I had a little trouble with making a website responsive. But I quickly got a hand of it because I went on code academy and started studying it more. </p>
<h1>Week 3</h1>
<p>This week we started our big project. In our project we are going to create a mobile website first, then we are going to make the site work on desktop. We also learned how to use sass. Sass is a lot alike css except sass helps break down the code. Sass does this by nesting the code. Nesting the code allows you to edit code without having to retype the code everytime you want to edit it. We started working on the project by first creating tasks that we have to follow in order to complete the project. We also decided to use scrum as our work metholodgy. So at the beginning of every class we meet with our group to talk about our progress and what are going to do.</p>
<h1>Week 4</h1>
<p>This week we countinued to work on our big project and we finished working on it this same week. We continued to use scrum and we had daily standups everyday. I was beginning to get stuck. I seeked my team for help and they came through. I ended up finishing most of the project. I even stayed after class a few days with Jesse to look over some of the issues I was running into. We did our best to help each other out but we also saw that our ways of coding were very differnt with few similarities. I countinued to work on my project throught the week and I turned in what I had.
<h1>Week 5</h1>
<p>We finished our project last week. First thing we did on Monday was go into a retrospective. In our retrospective we talked about what went well and what we could improve. We all agreed on that we could improve and we agreed that we needed to work on our commenting and peer reviewing because we all had differnt ways of coding. We learned new commands on terminal as well. We then learned new style guides. Style guides is a guide that has a set of rules for everyone to follow so the code looks familar to everyone in the team. The reasons for style guides is to have the team with familar code and have the team making progress. We learned java script as well this week. We started a new project with our team but this project will have two people working together. Caleb and I decided to work together. We started out by starting in our tasks then we started to layout our project.
  <h1>Week 6</h1>
  <p> We continued to layout our project more. We worked on wireframes for the project. Caleb started by creating the header and the sections that we assigned to him. After he finished that he sent the wireframes back to me. We did this multiple times for the multiple pages. We then created the html and collected images. We then later created the presets.</p>

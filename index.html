<h1>What I learned</h1>
<div>
  <h1>Week 1</h1>
<p>This week I learned how to use github. At first I was a little confused on what to do and how to use it. But first I leanred what it does. Once I learned what it does, I started to practice using it. I used it incorrectly at first but then I restarted my practice. I wrote down the steps of Github. Then I later countinued to practice with it. What you do is create a new branch at first. Thats where you do all your work. Once you complete all your work you have to commit and push your content. Then you go into Github and merge your branch and delete it. Once you do that you go back into Source Tree and go under your master branch then you fetch and pull your work. Once everything is pulled you can now delete your other branch. Then you repeat the steps on your next branch.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Week 2</h1>
<p>This week we created our groups. My group members are Davi, Caleb, Zach, and I. I beleive that we are a pretty solid group that can work well together. We also got new seats based on who is on our group. We also made a website that contained a resume. The website had a few requirements that could be easily met. While working on the project I learned new project manegment skills. We used Github for others in your group to peer review your code. We also wrote down what we learned in a word doc and our peer reviews as well. We also started to learn how to make websites resonsive. At first I had a little trouble with making a website responsive. But I quickly got a hand of it because I went on code academy and started studying it more. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Week 3</h1>
<p>This week we started our big project. In our project we are going to create a mobile website first, then we are going to make the site work on desktop. We also learned how to use sass. Sass is a lot alike css except sass helps break down the code. Sass does this by nesting the code. Nesting the code allows you to edit code without having to retype the code everytime you want to edit it. We started working on the project by first creating tasks that we have to follow in order to complete the project. We also decided to use scrum as our work metholodgy. So at the beginning of every class we meet with our group to talk about our progress and what are going to do.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Week 4</h1>
<p>This week we countinued to work on our big project and we finished working on it this same week. We continued to use scrum and we had daily standups everyday. I was beginning to get stuck. I seeked my team for help and they came through. I ended up finishing most of the project. I even stayed after class a few days with Jesse to look over some of the issues I was running into. We did our best to help each other out but we also saw that our ways of coding were very differnt with few similarities. I countinued to work on my project throught the week and I turned in what I had.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Week 5</h1>
<p>We finished our project last week. First thing we did on Monday was go into a retrospective. In our retrospective we talked about what went well and what we could improve. We all agreed on that we could improve and we agreed that we needed to work on our commenting and peer reviewing because we all had differnt ways of coding. We learned new commands on terminal as well. We then learned new style guides. Style guides is a guide that has a set of rules for everyone to follow so the code looks familar to everyone in the team. The reasons for style guides is to have the team with familar code and have the team making progress. We learned java script as well this week. We started a new project with our team but this project will have two people working together. Caleb and I decided to work together. We started out by starting in our tasks then we started to layout our project.
</p>
<div>
  <h1>Week 6</h1>
  <p> We continued to layout our project more. We worked on wireframes for the project. Caleb started by creating the header and the sections that we assigned to him. After he finished that he sent the wireframes back to me. We did this multiple times for the multiple pages. We then created the html and collected images. We then later created the presets.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Week 7</h1>
  <p>Caleb and I have been doing great in keeping our work seperate and going to each other when we needed help. We started finishing bigger sections. We started to code like each other and figured one method to follow our ways of coding. We started coding by coding by sections. We kept on commenting on every little thing to make sure that we are doing everything well and so we both know what our code means. We started to do Java Script now.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Week 8</h1>
  <p> We continued to do Javascript. It was tough at first but it is also heavy on logical thinking. We learned about functions and console logging. We also learned about vars, arrays, objects, and strings. Most of use weren't getting JavaScript at first but if you looked up more onto sites would tell you what does what and why. We starting on working on our finishing touches of our project.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Week 9</h1>
  <p>We continued to work on our finishing touches. Our finishing touches were a javascript and a few media queries. I finished the java script for the map the week before. I just had the javascript for the counterbar left. I was really stuck on that for awhile. I knew how to do the javascript but I was stuck on how I would layout the counterbar with the Javascript. I asked others on how they layed theirs out. Once I had a idea I finished mine then I did the media query for the counter. Later this week got our new project we 3 members. My team and I planned out our project and we got off to a good start.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Week 10</h1> <p>My group and I continued on the project we layed out our tasks and talked to each other about our strenghts in coding and our weaknessess so we could help each other out in the long run. Once we completed our tasks I made the wireframes. I made a rough draft of the wireframe and then I asked them what we could do to change the wireframe to make it work for all of us. Once we made our changes to our wireframe we decided to make our other wirframes for the other pages. We finished all our wireframes and started coding. Once we were off and coding we started to run into issues. </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Week 11</h1>
    <p> We started running into issues. Our gitignore was not made correctly. Our gitignore was not working when we thought we had it layed out correctly. Turns out the gitignore was missing the part where it ignores the map. So everytime we pushed it had a merge conflict due to github reading the map. We tried fixing it and it did not work out the first time we kept running into the issue. We went to another group for help. Luckily one of the other groups had the same problem and we ended up fixing it. We continued to work on project we were knocking out pages.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h1>Week 12</h1>
      <p>We received a second part to the project this week. I started out by being afraid that we might not get this project done in time due to the new work that was added on. But I slightly started to beleive that we are going to be fine due to the progress that my group was working. But then we started to make mistakes in our code. My teamates made similar classes to each others and ended up using editing each other classes on accident. We then resolved the issue and stated to each other that we need to move foward. We also decided to give classes specific names to avoid having to go back to fix code when we could be moving foward and finishing pages.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1> Week 13</h2>
        <p>We started to get closer to the end of the project we finished all the pages but all we need to do know is the javascript part of the project. We have been suggested to use Jquery. Other groups told us that it would help us out a lot. Our group decided that it would be a good idea. We set up Jquery finished up more pages and did a code academy in Jquery. We felt ready to tackel on the javascript sections now.</p>

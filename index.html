<h1>What I learned</h1>
<p>This week I learned how to use github. At first I was a little confused on what to do and how to use it. But first I leanred what it does. Once I learned what it does, I started to practice using it. I used it incorrectly at first but then I restarted my practice. I wrote down the steps of Github. Then I later countinued to practice with it. What you do is create a new branch at first. Thats where you do all your work. Once you complete all your work you have to commit and push your content. Then you go into Github and merge your branch and delete it. Once you do that you go back into Source Tree and go under your master branch then you fetch and pull your work. Once everything is pulled you can now delete your other branch. Then you repeat the steps on your next branch.</p>
<h1>Week 2</h1>
<p>This week we created our groups. My group members are Davi, Caleb, Zach, and I. I beleive that we are a pretty solid group that can work well together. We also got new seats based on who is on our group. We also made a website that contained a resume. The website had a few requirements that could be easily met. While working on the project I learned new project manegment skills. We used Github for others in your group to peer review your code. We also wrote down what we learned in a word doc and our peer reviews as well. We also started to learn how to make websites resonsive. At first I had a little trouble with making a website responsive. But I quickly got a hand of it because I went on code academy and started studying it more. </p>
